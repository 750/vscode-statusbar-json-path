Fork of https://github.com/richie5um/vscode-statusbar-json-path

Improvements:
* https://github.com/richie5um/vscode-statusbar-json-path/issues/30
* Triggering command will copy jsonpath even if extension is not activated (when open file is not `.json`). Useful when you have a very large json: just change it to `.txt` to disable syntax higlighting for better performance
